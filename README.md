# vagov-cy-tr-reporter

Custom Cypress-TestRail reporter for U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs&rsquo;
VA.gov website [front-end][vets-website].

## Forking NOT recommended

Although this package/repository is public\*, it is _not_ meant for Forking. Its
functionality is limited and customized for VA-internal processes and
intergations. VA-external contributions are not expected.

A much better choice for Forking would be [mocha-testrail-reporter][mtr]

\*Public access is enabled only to support transparency to general public and
enable easy team-internal hand-offs.
