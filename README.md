## Forking NOT recommended

You can download this open-source project and modify to suit your needs\*, instead of forking the repository.

Although this package/repository is public\*\*, it is _not_ meant for Forking. Its
functionality is limited and customized for VA-internal processes and
integrations. VA-external contributions are not expected.

A much better choice for Forking would be [mocha-testrail-reporter][mtr]

\*If you do download and modify, be sure to change the name and other properties in package.json before publishing your own package.

\*\*This repository is public only to (a) support open-source community, (b) promote government transparency, and (c) enable easy VA-internal hand-offs.
